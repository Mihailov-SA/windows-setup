A collection of scripts for fresh Windows 10 installs.

## Overview

A collection of scripts to customize a fresh Windows 10 install.

## Features

1. A "de-bloat" script that removes a lot of the bloat that is present after a fresh OS install. This script is based off of https://github.com/farag2/Windows-10-Setup-Script
2. An application installation script based on [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) that installs a specific set of packages from the chocolatey repo.

## Usage

### De-Bloat

The [de-bloat](./debloat.ps1) script runs through a long list of tweaks to reduce the amount of bloat present in a fresh OS install.

In order to run, from an elevated (aka, Run as Administrator) Powershell terminal run `.\debloat.ps1` and answer the prompts.

### Chocolatey

The [chocolatey](./setup.ps1) application setup script;

1. Checks to see if [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) is already installed (and installs it if it's not found).
2. Reads the contents of [applications](./applications.txt) file, and for every entry, installs the package from the [chocolatey repo](https://chocolatey.org/packages).
